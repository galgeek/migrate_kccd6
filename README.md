This repo contains my code to migrate a Portland Buddhist center's 
[Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) 6 site to Drupal 7. The Drupal 6 
site contained an array of content types and menus, far more than 
community volunteers maintaining the site could easily use. This 
migration gently refactored the site, its menus, and Drupal content 
types, adding a more easily maintained calendar and collection of 
audio recordings.  

I also installed [CiviCRM](https://civicrm.org/), adding a host of 
CRM-integrated forms and features.
